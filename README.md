###  Set up
To Run the application you will firstly need to install all the application
dependencies.

To do this run yarn install, if you don't have yarn installed,
please refer to this documentation (https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/).

Once done this, run yarn start, this will open the application on
http://localhost:5000

###  Notes
The app uses React as front end framework. There are 2 main components,
a stateful one app.js and a stateless one form.js.

### What would I have done better.

I think the solution around the calculateValue method in app.js, it is a good
working solution, but definitely there are better approach. If I had more time
I'd have done more research, and try to come up with a better optimized,
and scalable solution as the actual one it is very much tailored
for this project.

Also I'd have organized my sass even in a more modular way, like having
a button.scss, and a result.scss to further breakdown the app style.
